Country Content Controller will use the API from http://ip-api.com/ and block/show div id's based off the users country.

== Description ==

Country Content Controller allows a website owner the ability to hide/show divs to specific countries. This is done through the use of shortcodes on the specific page you want the content hidden. 

We use the api from http://ip-api.com/ to find the users country. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Browse to the CCC admin tab inside of your WordPress dashboard for a full breakdown on how to use the shortcode.

== Upgrade Notice ==
No dependents to worry about

Currently you can not, you would have to put multiple shortcodes. In the next release we wll provide this ability.
